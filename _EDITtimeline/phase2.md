In the next three years, three more towns were added to the project: Sao Bonifacio, Alfredo Wagner and Anit√°polis. The goal was to increase organic grass based dairy to 15 total farms, and also establish an organic dairy coop. Another project was to fence off recovering riparian areas of farms. At the end of three years, 43 farmers were involved, grass-based dairy became a reality, support group number increased to 6, and the Geracao Dairy Coop was opened and certified by ECOCERTE (the first to be certified in Brazil). Grants obtained from SEBRAE (Sustainable Rural Life Program) helped to mobilize progress.
