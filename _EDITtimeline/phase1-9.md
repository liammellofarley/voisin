As a result of the shift in grazing practices, farms were able increase the number of dairy cows, increase yield per cow, reduce the amount of silage used, and ultimately boost their income. Of the first 5 pilot farms, trust and friendship was established between the farmers, professors, students and technicians. The carrying capacity of the farms increased by 100%, milk yield increased by 50%, and farms experienced a 66% increase in profitability.
