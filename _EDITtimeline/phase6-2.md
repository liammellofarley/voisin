The major component of Brazilian forest code in play was the protection of Riparian zones. Riparian zones are woods around water bodies and streams, that provide a buffer zone and protect against erosion. Since they're highly important to the ecosystem but inconvenient for farmers a solution was found by foresting these areas with productive trees such as banana and acai.
