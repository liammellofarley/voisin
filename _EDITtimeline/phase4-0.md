Project partners with EPAGRI (Agriculture Research and Extension Agency of Santa Catarina) and receives grants from the Estate Extension Agency. Four Farmer Unions are formed, and Four Dairy Coops open: Darolt, Delta Vita, Doerner and (already established) Geracao. EPAGRI offices in 293 state towns, as well as partnerships with 857 Agronomists and veterinarians. The goal of this phase was to expand the pasture based dairy project for all of Southern Santa Catarina, and to train all state extension agents to help implement. As a result, the project now included 621 farmers from 53 towns. With help from EPAGRI, the state wide program became popular and sought after. “Family farm sustainable dairy production in Santa Catarina” won the Ecology Expression Award from the United Nations.
