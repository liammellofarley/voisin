Scientists have identified nine biophysical systems that must exist within a proposed safe operating space in order to support life on earth.  Four of these proposed boundaries, nitrogen biogeochemical flow, biodiversity loss, climate change, and land use change, have already been exceeded.  The current agricultural system is a central cause to these four critical thresholds already exceeding their boundaries and is a major threat to the global ecosystem.  Agroecology provides framework in which farmer and production needs can be met or exceeded while protecting and restoring local ecosystems.
